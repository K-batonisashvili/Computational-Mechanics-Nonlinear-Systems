Hello!

My name is Kote and I created 2 files for the warm-up section of assignment 1.

The first file is called bisection_warm_up.py which contains just the bisection algorithm.
    You can change the following in this file:
        1) Tolerance
        2) Number of iterations
    Please do not change any other parts of the code otherwise the algorithm will not run properly.

The second file is called bisection_tester.py
This file contains the example functions and test code to ensure proper formatting. 
You will be calling this file, or running it, to use my bisection algorithm.
To run this file please do the following:
    1) Open a terminal window
    2) Navigate to where bisection_tester.py and bisection_warm_up.py are located
    3) Type the following command: python bisection_tester.py
It should now run the python file with the algorithm.
Look at the terminal window for further instructions.
In general, the layout of my code for this file looks like this:
    1) First you are asked to select a left bound/interval
    2) Then you are asked to select a right bound/interval
    3) Then you are asked to select numbers 1 through 5 to try different tests
    4) You are presented with the zeros or the roots

Thank you for reading through!
