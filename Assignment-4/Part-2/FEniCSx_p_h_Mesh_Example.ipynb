    "# FEniCSx H and P Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be continuing our FEniCSx Bridge example, except this time we will be fully incoprorating the 3rd dimension and make our bridge a 3D structure. Last time, our bridge had a force applied to it at a single point at the center of the beam but in the Y direction. This time, we added depth and will be applying a downward force in the Z-axis. Before getting into the problem, please ensure that FEniCSx and DolfinX are installed on your computer. For assistance with installation, please refer to the `readme.md` for tips on installing the platform, creating a conda environment, activating it (also in your terminal/visual studio session), and running the Jupyter Notebook."

Differing from part 1, we are no longer applying a force as a point right in the middle of the bridge, instead we are applying a uniform load across the whole bridge. This should provide a good visualization distinction from what we saw previously. \n",
