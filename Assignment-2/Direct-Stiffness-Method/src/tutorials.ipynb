    "\n",
    "Elasto-plasticity describes how materials behave when subjected to loads beyond their elastic limit. Initially, a material deforms elastically (returns to its original shape when unloaded). Once stress exceeds the yield stress, plastic deformation occurs, meaning some deformation remains even after unloading.\n",

    "- **`E` (Elastic modulus)**  \n",
    "  - Represents the stiffness of the material.  \n",
    "  - A higher value means the material resists deformation more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Y_initial` (Initial yield stress)**  \n",
    "  - The stress level at which plastic deformation begins.  \n",
    "  - Below this value, the material behaves elastically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`H_iso` (Isotropic hardening modulus)**  \n",
    "  - Controls how much the yield stress increases with plastic strain.  \n",
    "  - A higher value means the material strengthens more as it undergoes plastic deformation.  \n",
