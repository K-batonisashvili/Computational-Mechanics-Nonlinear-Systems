    "\n",
    "The Direct Stiffness Method is used for the analysis of frames and different structures. We use the direct stiffness matrix in analyzing displacements, forces, and moments around nodes and elements. This notebook contains a tutorial on using this method to assemble the global stiffness matrix and use it to solve for displacements and reactions.\n",

    "### Example: Simple Beam Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "For example 1, we will analyze a simple beam structure which consists of two nodes and one element. The breakdown of the code is fairly straightforward. We first define our nodes with their given properties, we connect the nodes through defining elements with more properties, and finally we assemble them together in the frame class. Once the entire frame is assembled, we run the calculations method which runs through calculating the global stifness matrix, local matrices, and the way the nodes are affected. The results provide us with analysis of the forces and displacements.\n",

    "Optionally, you are able to input manual commands/variables through a defined function which prints everything out to the terminal. The `manual_input` function in `Direct_Stiffness` allows users to manually input values for nodes, elements, and boundary conditions through the terminal. This function provides a way to interactively define the structure and its properties without hardcoding them into the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt for Number of Nodes**: The function starts by asking the user to input the number of nodes in the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Nodes**: For each node, the user is prompted to enter the coordinates (x, y, z). The nodes are then created and stored in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define Elements**: The function then asks the user to define the elements by specifying the nodes they connect and their material properties such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, cross-sectional area, and moments of inertia.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Set Boundary Conditions**: For each node, the user is prompted to enter the boundary conditions, indicating whether each degree of freedom (DOF) is constrained or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return Nodes and Elements**: Finally, the function returns the lists of nodes and elements, which can be used to create the frame and perform the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, all you have to do to run the `manual_input` function is to un-comment `main` and `if __name__ == \"__main__\"`. Once you do that, simply run the direct_stifness.py file directly and you will have control over manually entering input.\n"
